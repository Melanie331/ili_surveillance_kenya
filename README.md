## Analyzing Regional Trends in Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) in Kenya: A Quantitative Epidemiology Case Study (Center for Epidemiological Modeling and Analysis)
The project analyzed influenza-like illnesses across various regions/counties in Kenya between 2023 and 2024 for informed public health survillance and well-informed IPC interventions.

### 1. Background
As an initial task at the Centre for Epidemiological Modeling and Analysis (CEMA), you are presented with a dataset from an epidemiological research project, "Analyzing Regional Trends in Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) in Kenya: A Quantitative Epidemiology Case Study." The study collected data on year (2023-2024), the epidemiological week (epi_week), county, age categories (age_group), percentage of outpatient visits due to ILI (ili_percentage), and the estimated population for that age group in that county (population). The objective is to evaluate temporal and county-specific ILI trends and interpret the findings to inform public health decisions.

### 2. Data
â€“ Raw Excel workbook containing all sheets:
[data/Epi_Task_Data.csv](data/Epi_Task_Data.csv)

### 3. Task process
##### a)	Descriptive analysis
- i.	Computing a table showing the mean ILI percentage per county per year.
- ii.	Plotting ILI weekly trend, identifying the peak ILI weeks across counties and describing the seasonal pattern of ILI cases.
##### b)	Computing epidemiological measures
- i.	Calculating the incidence rates per 100,000 population across three counties.
- ii.	Using a correlation to compare ILI percentages across any three counties.

### 4. Findings
